# The Art of User Experience

Great design is invisible - it just works. UX design focuses on creating meaningful and relevant experiences for users.

## Design Principles

### Visual Hierarchy
- Use typography to guide attention
- Consistent spacing and alignment
- Color for emphasis and organization

### User-Centered Design
- Research your users
- Test early and often
- Iterate based on feedback

## Tools of the Trade

Popular design tools include:
- **Figma** - Collaborative interface design
- **Adobe XD** - Prototyping and wireframing
- **Sketch** - Vector-based design

## Accessibility Matters

```css
/* Ensure sufficient color contrast */
.button {
  background: #007acc;
  color: #ffffff;
  /* Contrast ratio: 4.5:1 minimum */
}

/* Focus indicators for keyboard navigation */
.button:focus {
  outline: 2px solid #0066cc;
  outline-offset: 2px;
}
```

Good design considers all users, including those with disabilities.
