# What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions without being explicitly programmed.

## Types of Machine Learning

### Supervised Learning
- Uses labeled training data
- Examples: classification, regression

### Unsupervised Learning
- Finds patterns in data without labels
- Examples: clustering, dimensionality reduction

### Reinforcement Learning
- Learns through trial and error
- Examples: game playing, robotics

## Popular Libraries

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import scikit-learn as sklearn
```

Machine learning is transforming industries from healthcare to finance.
